    <h2>Quick Introduction <em>(that is really a novel in itself)</em></h2>

    <p>
      Hello Everyone, Ladies and Gents, Humans and Potential Non-Humans. My name is Kyra. It rhymes with Tyra.
      <small>I make the point since many people, are commonly confused on how to properly pronounce my first name due to there being an alternate pronounciation that doesn't make sense with the 'Y' but it's okay. I don't mind correcting people or overstating how to say my name in introductions. It can just be a bit tiring in all honesty</small>
    </p>

    <p>
      Some basic personal information about me to use as an overview or preview into the surface level of what makes me, who I am today.
    </p>

<h3>The Basics About Kyra</h3>

<img src="images/overview.png" alt="Here's a Quick Overview About Me">

    <ul>
      <li>
        I am 22 years old.
      </li>
      <li>
         Born in 2000 so technically that makes me a Gen Z (but in all honestly I understand more Millenial slang and culture so I like to identify as a Zillenial)
      </li>
      <li>
        My Astrological Sun Sign is Capricorn <em>I don't strongly follow Astrology but I do find it fascinating and an interesting topic overall.</em>
      </li>
      <li>
        I am the product of young parents. <small>So a lot of people are shocked whenever they say somehting about my generations and their generation in a conversation then ask me how old my parents are but then realize they are older than my parents who are 41 and 39.</small>
      </li>
      <li>
        I am able to speak Lao conversationally enough and resort to 'Laolish' when conversations become more complex
      </li>
      <li>
        Lao is my first langauge and is my native language but unfortunately I am not as fluent as I used to be due to English becoming my dominantly used language.
      </li>
      <li>
        I am half 1st Gen American and half 2nd Gen American
      </li>
      <small>Hear me out though. My biological father who was the same age as my Dad (Step-Dad but he raised me as his own) was 1st Gen American under his family tree. While my mother had immigrated to the U.S with her family at a very young age (toddler age) after the Vietnam War. So with mom's side of the family (which I am much more comfortable and closer with) I am 1st Gen American</small>
    </ul>

    <h3>Fun Facts About My Heritage/Culture</h3>
<img src="images/laos.png" alt="Lao Flag and Traditionally Dressed Characters">
    <ul>
      <li>
        If you google it, Laos is the most bombed country in the world because of the Vietnam War.
      </li>
      <li>
        Most Lao people are mistakenly reffered to as Laotian
      </li>
      <li>
        The difference between a Lao person and someone who is Laotian, is that someone who is Lao comes from the more native side of the country- meaning they and their family speaks Lao and are very involved in Lao traditions/cultural things.
        While the term Laotian will refer to someone who is not ethnically Lao. Nationality wise they are Laotian.
      </li>
      <li>
        There are 50 main ethnic groups in Laos and 160 Ethnic Subgroups
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Kyra's Schooling Story Introduction</h2>
<img src="images/school.png" alt="Selfie While Video Editing">
      <p>
        I am in my last year and last term of my A.S Degree within Digital Cinema in Television/Film Production.
        Throughout the time of completing my degree I have earned 2 certifications so far. I have been certified in Digital Video Fundamentals and Video Editing & Post Production.
      </p>

      <p>
        My plans after completing this degree I will not be using Seminole State College's Direct-Connect to UCF.
        That is because of my financial aid. I am very aware that my grant is limited and if I have already used half or close to half for my current degree, there is no way that it would last me through a full term at UCF with their prices.
      </p>

      <p>
        That is not the very end of the plan in continuing on with my education, I have more to tell you.
        As I have conversed with my advisor before on the next step to take, they understand where I am coming from in the decision to complete another A.S Degree where my current credits can transfer.
        The only department I will be able to transfer to is the Digital Media department.
      </p>

      <p>
        Within the Digital Media Program, there are 2 choices in A.S Degrees to choose from, which are a focus in Game Design or Web Design.
      </p>

      <p>
        I am very aware that when it comes to success in finding work and when it comes to more demand, that'll mean more job opportunities due to consumer demand is in Web/Graphic Design.
        Although, I have already completed most of my Film Studies that is enough to kickstart me in where I, ideally would like to work in as a field.
      </p>

      <p>
        With that being said, I have chosen Digital Media in Game Design as the focus. I have also done my research in classes that both degrees offer.
        Game Design offers, more classes that will help me expand my knowledge and skillsets within the video production field.
        There's classes that are focused on Storytelling and Character Development. Not to mention, a lot of art rules do crossover into video and photography such as Perspective, Composition, and Lighting.
